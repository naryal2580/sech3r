# S√©Ch3r v3.0
A Security HTTP-Header Checker.  # Make it Dry!

#### NOTE: Present Headers does not mean it is secure.

## What? Why? Where? How?

### What is This?

> This is a tool, written by [naryal2580](https://google.com#q=naryal2580) or, [Captain Nick Lucifer](https://duckduckgo.com?q=naryal2580). It is a tool to determine the presence of Security  HTTP-Headers of a URL.

### Why is This?

> This is written in `python3` to check if `Security HTTP-Headers are present` also, to check if `Version Disclosure is present`. 

### Where is This?

> This is right here! üòÅ You can just simply `git clone https://github.com/naryal2580/sech3r`, and use it within Inter-net or, an Intra-net.

### How does This work?

> It makes a `GET` HTTP-Request to the given URL. And, then parses the HTTP-Response Headers. [blah^2^] Check `sech3r -v` flag to know what is happening.
